GIT intros

Version control software to be used with any files, not normally good with binary as these are compilable files, these types of files can change easily. On the other hand text based editors work better. CVS, Perforce, RCS, subversion are other version control softwares but these typically have a central machine that we all communicate with. Code is locked onto a server and no-one else can get it. GIT differs and has distributed development in mind.

Encourage regular branches, push changes often, …

Largest web base repositories are gitHub and gitlab. No real difference but we are using gitlab

Copy the repository link and put it directory using ‘git clone’

This is empty repository so we need to add files

In the directory we created in terminal, add a file called read me with vim README.md

Git status asks whats going on in the directory that git is managing

Add files with git add * To add all files in the tracked directory

Git commit -m ‘what am I doing in the present’ README.md (so note we commit changes for a files one at a time) this prepares code on the branch?

Git push to push code to the server. Now the web page looks different

Git diff readmd.md to see the differences in the files 

Remeber git likes to branch, branching is a way of separating out groups of changes

Git branch add_extra_files to create a new branch

Git branch to view branches

Git checkout add_extra_files to make switch master branch

A merge request is when you have a branch and you want to merge it to any branch or master, and you could use the link provided

Either do merge locally or through merge request, Generally tend to run fetch and then the merge command 

I create the request, I assign it to myself as I am working on my own project

Complete the merge request on the webpage repository

Git pull works on current branch, git fetch gets all files

Git log gives the summary for the whole project

You can do git diff between the hash keys which gives you the difference

You can merge branches using git merge add_extra_files
